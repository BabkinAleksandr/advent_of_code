# Advent of Code Solving

Just me practicing new languages by solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
I'm not an expert in either of laguages I've used, but I tried to do my best to write as much idiomatic code as I can.

To run a program, `cd` to the directory with Makefile _(e.g. /2023/2/c)_ and execute:

```bash
make run
```

To run different parts separately, execute:

```bash
make run1
# or
make run2
```

## Structure

Code is categorized by year and day. Each day has a catalog named by a language.
Each day could have the same program in different languages.

**Repo does not include program input data.** As it's recommended on AoC webiste,
I do not commit a copy of input data, but to make things work, put your input in a `input.txt` file in a directory with program.

I've tried to do without using common code for different solutions to make programs self-contained and portable.
It's not a requirement, but I think it's just a good approach.

Also, for the sake of education, I use only standard library of a language.

## Languages

I'm quite inconsistent in solving all days in all languages, but eventually
I'd like to finish solutions in all languages I'm interested in.

Currently it is:
- C
- Go
- Erlang
- Zig
